Tweet using python on tweeter

This is tweeter bot which will tweet twice a day.

It will read an excel sheet from my own google account. Randomly select one row.
Tweet that highlight from excel with book and authur info.
and it will delete that row from excel and save it to new excel file.

It fits my use case. Feel free to use tinker with it.
